During the 21st century, waves of protests have shaken the world. Often it is the aspiration for more social justice and refusal of authoritarian regimes that triggered this movement. It reached a point where protests tend to shape the leaders in place and their ways of governing. Citizens are now fully engaging in politics through demonstrations.
However, marching and sitting in front of institutions is not always successful in modifying politics. Sometimes it even can get worse, ending up in a civil war like in Yemen.  So how can we assess the success of a protest? Could we predict that demonstrations will be worth it and not end up in the worst scenario?
In particular, the case of the Arab Spring illustrates diverse options of protest consequences: destitution of authoritarian and corrupted presidents, new elections. Some of them end up in violent killings of protesters and war. In our project, we will look at quantitative variables to demonstrate the influence of the protests on politics and the economy to understand better their actual impacts on a state.
