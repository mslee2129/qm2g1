Regression Method

In order to analyse the relationship between the unemployment rate/corruption rate and the number of protests, we decided to perform multi-linear regression on the three variables, as this would provide us an insight into the nature and accuracy of the correlation. The regression was performed on the already cleaned datasets, with all the data being provided for 158 countries. Using the Scikit-Learn library on Python, we created a linear regression model for each country in the region using its unemployment rate and corruption rate as the independent variable, and the number of protests of that country as the dependent variable. Using the regression performed on the data, the Statsmodel library provides us a method that calculates the r2 and adjusted r2 values for each of the models, which is a way to compute the accuracy of the multi-linear regression model. The closer the r2 values of the regression model are to 1, the closer the model is to the approximation of the real data points. After performing multi-linear regression on the data, we could analyse the correlation between the datasets using the values given by the calculations.
