This project might also have a broader intention. Studying protests is crucial to understand the evolution of democracy. Indeed, protesting is the way people shape power, politics, and economics. Indeed, we have seen that the consequences of protests are tangible in a country as it can profoundly change a political system in place for decades. Thus, this project could help better understand these political mutation processes through population empowerment and the risks it represents. Of course, our project only considers corruption and unemployment rates, which are not enough to provide a complete analysis of protests. We would need far more social indicators to draw adequate conclusions. However, we are still contributing on a small scale to these new critical protest studies.
