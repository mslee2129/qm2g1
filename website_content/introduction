During the 21st century, waves of protests have shaken the world. Often it is the aspiration for more social justice and refusal of authoritarian regimes that triggered this movement. It reached a point where protests tend to shape the leaders in place and their ways of governing. Citizens are now fully engaging in politics through demonstrations.
However, marching and sitting in front of institutions is not always successful in modifying politics. Sometimes it even can get worse, ending up in a civil war like in Yemen.  So how can we assess the success of a protest? Could we predict that demonstrations will be worth it and not end up in the worst scenario?
In particular, the case of the Arab Spring illustrates diverse options of protest consequences: destitution of authoritarian and corrupted presidents, new elections. Some of them end up in violent killings of protesters and war. In our project, we will look at quantitative variables to demonstrate the influence of the protests on politics and the economy to understand better their actual impacts on a state. 



From this graph, we can see that the amount of protests increased strikingly especially since 2008. Democracy, humans right, anti-neocapitalism, climate change, women’s and Black’s rights are all the kind of current concerns that encourages people to march, demonstrate, sit in front of public buildings and, to sing and shout for their causes. In 2008, a global economical crisis has left millions of people without a job and led to many years of inflation. This crisis had tremendous social consequences such as famines that probably contributed to this global trend of anti-system revolts characterized by the rejection of the State in place and the economy that exploits the poor and the environment.
