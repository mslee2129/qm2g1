What are protests?

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a protest can be defined simply as “a strong complaint expressing disagreement, disapproval, or opposition” (cite). However, protests are much more complex than the definition that this dictionary gives heed to. Protests can take on various forms, including but not limited to marches, sit-ins, petitions, strikes and boycotts. They could be peaceful or could cause armed conflicts. Finally, as the definition states, protests occur to express feelings of opposition and suggests an overarching goal to demand change. It is important to note that the goals of protests can differ, with potential reasons being: bringing awareness and knowledge to perceived injustices, influencing public opinions, pushing for certain public policies and connecting with and inspiring those who share similar sentiments on the issue at hand (cite). As such, it is difficult to generalize protests into a simplified meaning and one must consider all the different contexts when evaluating these events. 

Why are people protesting?

In recent years, the number of protests have increased greatly, spiking during the year of the Arab Spring in 2011 and continuing this growing trend ever since (cite). Today, protests are considered to “have become a common phenomenon” with them happening everywhere in the world, in all different contexts; developed or developing, high inequality or low inequality, democratic or autocratic, it seems no country can hide from this form of public unrest. What has caused protests to increase? Why are people protesting more today? Many have tried to find ways to answer these questions by looking at the root: the triggers that cause protests. One of the dominant theories that looks at the fuels of protests noted that grievances related to relative deprivation have been shown to increase the probability of protests occurring. This relative deprivation is felt from witnessing a gap between expectations and achievements (https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315631073). A second theory is based on the fact that high and increasing economic inequality leads to poor social cohesion and can cause a detriment to political stability (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095339). This research will be focussing on the latter and exploring the effects of economic and political pressure on protests.
