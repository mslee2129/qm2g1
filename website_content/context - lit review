What are protests?

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a protest can be defined simply as “a strong complaint expressing disagreement, disapproval, or opposition” (cite). However, protests are much more complex than the definition that this dictionary gives heed to. Protests can take on various forms, including but not limited to marches, sit-ins, petitions, strikes and boycotts. They could be peaceful or could cause armed conflicts. Finally, as the definition states, protests occur to express feelings of opposition and suggests an overarching goal to demand change. It is important to note that the goals of protests can differ, with potential reasons being: bringing awareness and knowledge to perceived injustices, influencing public opinions, pushing for certain public policies and connecting with and inspiring those who share similar sentiments on the issue at hand (cite). As such, it is difficult to generalize protests into a simplified meaning and one must consider all the different contexts when evaluating these events. 

Why are people protesting?

In recent years, the number of protests have increased greatly, spiking during the year of the Arab Spring in 2011 and continuing this growing trend ever since (cite). Today, protests are considered to “have become a common phenomenon” with them happening everywhere in the world, in all different contexts; developed or developing, high inequality or low inequality, democratic or autocratic, it seems no country can hide from this form of public unrest. What has caused protests to increase? Why are people protesting more today? Many have tried to find ways to answer these questions by looking at the root: the triggers that cause protests. One of the dominant theories that looks at the fuels of protests noted that grievances related to relative deprivation have been shown to increase the probability of protests occurring. This relative deprivation is felt from witnessing a gap between expectations and achievements (https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315631073). A second theory is based on the fact that high and increasing economic inequality leads to poor social cohesion and can cause a detriment to political stability (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095339). This research will be focussing on the latter and exploring the effects of economic and political pressure on protests.


In this project we decided to look at protests in particular in the context of the Arab Spring as it represents a quite important dataset on the topic. The Arab Spring is a pro-democracy movement that took place in the Middle East and North Africa from 2010 to mid-2012. It started with the so-called Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia and then spread to Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain, where either rulers deposed or sustained riots continued for years. Smaller protests linked to this revolution appeared in Kuwait, Oman, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Iran, Iraq and Lebanon. In the Middle East, most of the countries were under authoritarian and corrupt regimes. Thus, the wealth was not equally redistributed. Moreover, even though the overall education level increased in the region (Campante and Chor, 2012, p.172), it still had the highest unemployment rate in the world in 2005: 14,3 % (Nimrod Raphaeli, 2006). According to Huntington (1968, p.48), higher education did not always provide the needed skills for the market. This gap between high educated students and a poor labor market creates instability which causes rebellious movement. Indeed, according to Campante and Chor, the well educated young people are the most eager to be politically engaged in protests (2012, p.177). Thus, we can assume that these protests are associated with an overall political, social and economical context in favor of rebellion where corruption and unemployment are the main triggers.
 To analyze further on, we look at the cases of Tunisia and Yemen as they both went through particularly impressive revolutions. In Tunisia, the Jasmine Revolution was a popular uprising against corruption, poverty, and political repression, that led to the destitution of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. It started with the immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, a young fruit and vegetable vendor in Sidi Bouzid in front of a local municipal office, after he was being mistreated by the police. This event led to the first demonstration in the city which inspired others in the country. The protests sustained even when the police started to shoot protesters. It finally ended when Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia and was charged for manslaughter, drug trafficking, and conspiracy against the State. In Yemen, President Ali Abd Allāh Sālih was holding power for three decades, binding it to an economic underdevelopment stage. In late January 2011, thousands of protesters gathered in important cities to destitute him. At the beginning, the demonstrations took place with little violence between protesters and security officers. Then, Salih loyalists opened fire on protesters on March 18, killing at least 50 people. Even as clashes intensified between police and protesters, Salih still refused several times to sign the agreement that would remove him from power. He finally transferred his authority to Vice President Hadi.
