LIMITATIONS

As with all projects, it is important to note the limitations to the research. In this project, due to its reliance on quantitative research and analysis, the main limit lies within the data used, in particular, the protests data. This is due to the fact that the quantity of protests accounted for in the dataset may not be completely representative of all the protests that occurred in the world. Since the protests data only considered protests that were found in articles (within the New York Times, Washington Post, Christian Science Monitor, Times of London, and Jerusalem Post) containing the keywords: Protest, Demonstration, Riot or Mass mobilization, some protests that may not have had media coverage or forcefully censored by institutions were not included in the data.
Furthermore, because of the scope of our project, we could only consider two social indicators, unemployment rate and corruption index, and assumed that these indicators were completely representative of a countryâ€™s economic and political situation. However, the research findings could have been more accurate to the real world context if we had more time and resources to widen our scope and look at data from all the economic and political indicators such as GDP or poverty rate. 

ETHICS

The first ethical consideration was in terms of our data selection. All the datasets used within this project were open-source and access to the data was granted by its owners. Furthermore, we also ensured that our methodology was included in the website. This allows for full transparency on how our research used the data and how we presented, analyzed and made conclusions from the data. By including our methodology, we are able to show that no bias influenced our research findings, and the creation of our visualizations used the data that was not manipulated or changed, as to avoid fake news.
