"IQ.CPA.TRAN.XQ","CPIA transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector rating (1=low to 6=high)","Transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector assess the extent to which the executive can be held accountable for its use of funds and for the results of its actions by the electorate and by the legislature and judiciary, and the extent to which public employees within the executive are required to account for administrative decisions, use of resources, and results obtained. The three main dimensions assessed here are the accountability of the executive to oversight institutions and of public employees for their performance, access of civil society to information on public affairs, and state capture by narrow vested interests.","World Bank Group, CPIA database (http://www.worldbank.org/ida).",
